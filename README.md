# Climate Resilience & Investment Strategy for Hampshire Sparkling Wine Production

This repository explores whether **French Champagne producers** (specifically the case of Taittinger) should consider **long-term investment in vineyards and sparkling-wine production in Hampshire, UK**. The work evaluates the role of **climate change**, its projected effects on viticulture suitability, and the commercial viability of English sparkling wine as a strategic expansion option.

This work was developed as part of an **independent research exercise at Imperial College London**.  
The project is **archived / paused** — core structure and early-stage analysis are included here, but full production modelling, statistical forecasts, and commercial conclusions were **not fully completed**. Future updates may refine and extend the modeling approach.

## 🎯 Core Question

**Should French Champagne houses invest in long-term sparkling wine operations in Hampshire, UK?**

---

## 🧭 Research Strategy

The project frames the investigation as a sequence of data-driven experiments:

| Research Question | Approach |
|---|---|
| Is Hampshire currently suitable for high-quality viticulture? | Climate baseline analysis & grape suitability metrics |
| How will **climate change** affect Hampshire’s viticulture conditions? | Use historical climate data + future climate projections (UKCP18 / CMIP6) |
| Will climate change be **positive, negative, or neutral** for sparkling wine quality and yield? | Temperature band analysis, phenology modelling, frost & heat stress trends |
| How might these changes affect the **commercial wine sector** over the next 50 years? | Economic & competitive landscape review |

Each analytical step follows a standard structure:

## 📌 Status

This project is **not currently under active development**.

It is kept here as:

- A reference for others interested in climate impacts on viticulture
- A possible foundation for future deeper modelling and publishing
- Documentation of research methodology as part of academic work

Future extensions may include:

- Vineyard suitability GIS modelling
- CMIP6 ensemble phenology forecasts
- Yield & quality index modelling
